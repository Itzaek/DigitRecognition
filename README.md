# DigitRecognition
This project is based off of a project forked from https://github.com/heanuea/Mnist-Digit-Reader-. This project was hosted by the Artificial Intelligence Society at Carleton University.

A model is trained on a data set of numbers provided by MNIST and will be implemented in a website to allow for user interaction. A black box is used to "draw" the number the user wants and by utilized the trained model, a printed response of the guess of the number will be shown below.
